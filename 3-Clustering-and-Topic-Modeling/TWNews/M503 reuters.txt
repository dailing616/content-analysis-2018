Beijing brushes off Taipei air route complaint

Beijing does not need Taiwan's permission to open air routes, an official said after a complaint that a new one over the Taiwan Strait for flights between Hong Kong and Shanghai poses a risk.

Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen, who was elected two years ago to Beijing's displeasure as she belongs to the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, said the opening of the route close to two groups of Taiwan-controlled islands off the mainland coast was an irresponsible act threatening security and affecting aviation safety. Taiwan officials added that this month's opening of the northbound M503 route over the strait was done without informing Taipei, contravening a 2015 deal to discuss flight paths before making changes.

In Beijing, however, Ma Xiaoguang of China's Taiwan Affairs Office said Taipei had been informed the route would be opening.

Ma then added: "But this does not mean opening air routes needs Taiwan's agreement."


He also said there was no impact on aviation safety. Rather, there was a need to alleviate pressure on busy routes between Hong Kong and Shanghai.

The route was approved by the International Civil Aviation Organization, Ma added, and Taiwan should stop looking for opportunities to make a fuss.

Taipei claims the route is so close to the middle line of the Taiwan Strait that it affects air force exercises and other flight operations.
