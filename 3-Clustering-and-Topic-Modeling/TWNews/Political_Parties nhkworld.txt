Possible link between Chinese spy and Taiwan party

Prosecutors in Taiwan say a former Chinese student may have contacted members of a pro-Beijing political party under the instruction of Chinese authorities, and formed a secret organization with them.

The allegations involve a 30-year-old Chinese national and officials of a small Taiwanese party that advocates unification with Beijing. The Chinese man is currently appealing a prison sentence for espionage handed down last September.

Prosecutors said on Tuesday that the man was working under the instruction of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, and pledged to provide funds of about 450,000 dollars annually for 3 years to aid the activities of the party officials.

The prosecutors said the party officials accepted about 200,000 dollars. The party denies the allegations.

Taiwanese media report that China's Taiwan Affairs Office has also dismissed the allegations as baseless.
